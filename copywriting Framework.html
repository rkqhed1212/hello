    <title>Interactive Analysis of Copywriting & CRM Leaders</title>
    <!-- Chosen Palette: Warm Neutral Harmony -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The SPA is designed as an interactive dashboard to deconstruct the dense report. A primary navigation panel allows users to select a leader, which dynamically updates a central content area with their specific profile, including visualized frameworks and key metrics. This is followed by a comparative analysis section featuring an interactive radar chart to visually contrast leader philosophies. This non-linear, task-oriented structure was chosen over a simple linear scroll to empower users to easily explore, compare, and synthesize the information, dramatically improving usability and comprehension. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 
        - Report Info: Individual Leader Profiles -> Goal: Inform/Explore -> Viz/Presentation: Dynamic HTML cards with styled tags (for Tone/Style) and custom HTML/CSS process diagrams (for Frameworks) -> Interaction: Click leader's icon to update the main view -> Justification: Transforms walls of text into scannable, visually engaging, and structured information blocks. Library: Vanilla JS.
        - Report Info: Comparison of Leader Philosophies -> Goal: Compare/Analyze -> Viz/Presentation: Interactive Radar Chart -> Interaction: User can toggle leaders on/off via checkboxes to see their philosophies plotted against dimensions like 'Data-Driven' or 'Empathy-Focused' -> Justification: Provides powerful, immediate, and multi-dimensional visual comparison of qualitative data, which is far more insightful than reading paragraphs of comparative text. Library: Chart.js.
        - Report Info: Overarching Principles -> Goal: Summarize/Inform -> Viz/Presentation: Styled HTML cards in a grid layout -> Interaction: Static display for clarity -> Justification: Presents the key takeaways of the report in a clear, digestible format.
